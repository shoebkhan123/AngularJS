<!--In AngularJS, a service is a function, or object, that is available for, and limited to, your AngularJS application.

AngularJS has about 30 built-in services. One of them is the $location service.
-->
The $location service has methods which return information about the location of the current web page:
<html>
<head>
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>

</head>
<body>
	<div ng-app = 'app' ng-controller = 'contr'>
		<p>The URL of this page is: </p>
		<h3>{{pageUrl}}</h3>
	</div>

<script>
	angular.module('app', []).controller('contr', function($scope, $location) {
		$scope.pageUrl = $location.absUrl();
	
	});
</script>
</body>
</html>
